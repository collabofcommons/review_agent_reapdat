0,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Arpit Singla,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Absolutely enjoyed my lunch at Madras Restaurant recently. The ghee masala dosa was fantastic and tasty. What makes south india food more flavourful is the chutneys and i loved the red and coconut chutney here. The vadas were fresh and crunchy and for the first time in Canada i enjoyed having dahi vada at a south indian restaurant. The taste was just like back home in India. The service was quick, restaurant was clean and had a great vibe. Overall me and my family had a memorable experience and we will definitely be coming again. Do try their lassi also. It‚Äôs refreshing."
1,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Jay Goswami,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",11 months ago,"To start with service, we received food quickly. However food quality is not that great. All chatnies and sambhar were watery and sour in taste. Dosas were way too average. Medu vadas were fried twice and soaked in oil. Idlies were big in size and cooked unevenly. One side was very hard and one side was uncooked. Overall not happy with the quality of food.Owner has responded to my review. So I will have to edit my review. I did not order extra sambhar. I actually order extra white coconut chutney. Reason being sambhar was not good. Eating food to the last bite is my own concern as we are paying for food and we don‚Äôt like to waste food as many people stay hungry. Writing review or giving feedback at restaurant itself is my personal choice and you should not have a say on it. I value my time and Don need any lecture on it. As far as review system you also have right to respond. Good luck and hopefully you guys will expand more."

The sambhar and chutney was amazing tasted just like home! We also tried biryani which was a slight let down as there was less salt, but we ended the night with the filter coffee. And I would say that was the best one I have had since I've been in Brampton!  Definitely coming back to try more dosas!Thank you for your service!"
3,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Nameeta Kashyap,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",a year ago,This I would specially like to mention the service is very good. I liked my ghee Masada dosa very nicely done but I think sambar lacked the punch and the idli was not softVada was hot and piping which was really nice. I like the coconut and red chutney but green one was too salty.

5,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Sudharshan Nandakumar,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"My friend took me to this restaurant and I glad that he did. We ordered Chicken Curry combo thali and Madras Coffee. The Chicken was prepared in same way we prepare at home with coconut and fresh roasted and ground species. The curry was little spicy but I did not mind as I like spicy food which gives heat and makes me sweat.I just have one suggestion related to this dish. The volume of Curry should be reduced, because I did not get to eat rice with other curries.I will return again and refer more of friends to go here.Thank you to chef who prepared the food."
6,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Rahul Awasthi,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Even though I do not belong to South India I was craving for some hot, fresh south indian food because of the pandemic lockdown. Because I had been to Madras restaurant before I came back here to try some of the new dishes. üòã We tried the Hakka Chilli garlic Idli along with vada/dosa regulars. Hakka idli wasn't super awesome but definitely worth trying once for a different taste. I am just happy that dining has resumed and looking forward to eating out more often now. You should also try their mango lassi if you are into that.Images"
7,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Deepanshu Kainthola,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,I wish this place was closer to my home so I could visit more often. I have tried many South Indian restaurants in and around Toronto but this yummy experience was by far the best.I had a butter masala dosa and the taste definitely reminded me of food in India.It seems the chefs knows what they are making and for whom.A must visit if you are looking to try a new south indian place. You will keep coming back for sure.

11,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Pradeep Narayanan,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"I am sorry to say that I was Not impressed with their food. It lacked the genuineness that's synonymous to the name after which they have named their restaurant and has no connection whatsoever...though (politically) the name Madras was already renamed to Chennai but the legacy stands tall...alas, not in this case. There was simply nothing that stood common as I desperately tried to find something that binds them. Sorry for a negative review but I was not a happy camper :(Vegetarian options: Plain dosa was bland and tasteless:("
12,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Sparsh Sharma,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,Menu is very limited. Service and food quantity aren't bad. Taste though needs a major improvement. All the chutnies and sambhar were watery and the former weren't too good in taste or fresh either.I just enjoyed the hot masala dosas without chutney & sambhar.Mysore masala dosa tasted almost like a masala dosa.Rava dosa wasn't available.Chilly fried idlis weren't exactly how you'd expect them to be.
13,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Rishi Sri Lekha,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,Our experience at this Restaurant was beyond amazing..Good quantity and superb tasty food.

15,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Rajveer Singh,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,"Where do i start? Dosa‚Äôs are hands down their biggest strengths. The other options are good as well and the refreshments section is loaded. The service is excellent. The directors of the restaurant are humble and very forthcoming. Also, let me in you on a secret. The panner tikka masala dosa with added cheese is one of the best dosa‚Äôs that I have ever tasted. So, if you ever visit Madras, do not miss out on this hidden gem."
16,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Bunny Bird,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a week ago,"One time I gave 5 stars to this place, but I haven't dined or done take out in a while. Sure enough this time when I did take out order, I found a  long piece of black hair inside my masala dosa. That's absolutelty disgusting and not acceptable. A big thumbsdown.

18,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Rubi Kaur,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"Took too long to make one order even though the whole restaurant was empty, they were 3 in store, keep doing there own work instead of serving the guest at counter. Weird. I have no personal grudges as i work with food sector aswell, but if we have dine in guest atleast somebody should be at counter to help guests."
19,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Swanand Ketkar,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Not a good experience overall. We ordered for a takeout and the order taker was pretty rude on the phone. To tell about the good side only the Idli and sambar had a good taste. We had Dal wada which was half cooked and not fluffy at all, the chutneys were not tasty and the dosa with it's vegetables was tasteless as well. I would not recommend the place to anybody."
20,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Karan Miglani,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,We always order authentic dosa and loved it but this time I tried paneer tikka masala dosa but regretted after I ate it. Chicken biryani always fresh and Hakka idly is best at par. Kids didn‚Äôt like their cheese dosa though.
21,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Sally P,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,"Very disappointed. I was at your restaurant on the 28th of June 2022 at around 3pm. My friend and I were very hungry and was so looking for a tasty south Indian food such as Thali and Briyani. We are South Indians. I ordered a plate of Thali and she ordered mutton Biriyani. To my disappointment the Thali was not Thali at all. Please go visit another South Indian Restaurant and learn from them about serving a proper Thali. There was RICE, SAMBAR, RASAM tasted nothing like Rasam, Channa Korma with Panner, curd, Kulab Jamun, Chapati and Pappadam. Since when did Channa Korma became a South Indian dish. The channa mix was so salty which I even informed the waiter. when i stood up to pay, then did I realize the cook was a North/East Indian  lady. How could you hire a N/E Indian to cook South Indian Food. South Indian food flavor comes from our spices. There is a vast difference in N/E Indian cooking to South Indian cooking. To top it off you have a sign board that reads -True Taste of South Indian Food- are you serious, buddy?"
22,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Sneha Sharma,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a month ago,"Visited restaurant yesterday, not great food experience, ordered chicken 65, veg thali and non-veg thali. Chicken 65 was not dry as in pictures rather semi gravy style.Both thali had very small quantity of rice served , additional rice charged for $5! Chapati served in thali was kind of reheated. Rasam was mere water with no flavors in it!"

28,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Prabhjot kaur,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"Worst service ever. Staff was so unprofessional, they don‚Äôt know how to take orders and how to serve. They took our order and then again came back to reconfirm they themselves doesnt know what they have on menu. Then we waited for 30 minutes for just 2 items and they were serving other people who came after us nd when i asked the girl who was taking orders that what is happening why is it taking so long then she just said ok i will bring urs and after few minutes other girl came nd reconfirmed the order. I mean after waiting for long 30 minutes somebody is confirming nd asking did u ordered if yes then what did u ordered. Then also after reconfirming they didnt showed up with our order at last we left by just paying for pop we ordered nd they were least bothered that customer left without eating. So i would give them not even a zero but negative stars for worst staff, worst service.Thanks for replying and considering The issue i raised. Hope you guys grow much more."

It is in business since last 1 year and yet the service is still very slow.We ordered for a South Indian Thali and the owner said he will take 20-30 mins to get it ready. As we didnt have any choice we waited and saw other getting served who came after us. It was clear that the item we ordered is not a fast going item and wasn't important for the owner.The food was average, the service was slow and the layout of the tables are messy.The ladies and men's rooms are more of a storage unit than washrooms.You can go to this place only if all the other options have a long wait time or if you are friends with owner."

This place has my full recommendation. I will be visiting again with family to try their Dosas.The lady who greeted me was also very good natured and cheerful.P.S I forgot to mention filter coffee that I ordered on the side - which was amazing.

If everyone else is happy, it means that they don't bother that much, or she gave stale chutney only with my dosa.

193,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,amrita randhawa,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,Just awful food. I've lived in south India and I know how dosas and chutneys are made and taste. I ordered a rava onion dosa and it came with raw onions sprinkled on the dosa instead of being cooked with the dosa batter. The masala inside it was bland and tasteless. I could taste the raw haldi that wasn't even cooked properly. The chutneys were just as fake as they could be. The so called coconut chutney was just yogurt with tadka and the other chutneys had already fermented to the point that they were not edible at all. The other dosa we ordered was mysore dosa and it was as tasteless as it could be. I think this is probably the worst indian place ever I've been to. We got sick as soon as we reached home. A complete waste of time and money. Never going back and never recommending it to anyone. Their neighbors (rajdhani) do a better job at basic food items at half the price than these guys. Sticking to guru laxmi or nilgiris from now on.

But yesterday when I told the manager about the tasteless food then he started justifying that‚Äôs it was the same chef and expected me to be visiting again! Seriously ?? Do you think after eating almost nothing from the so called Thali, and paying 25$ for a stale food, I will visit again. The quantity and pricing is pure absurd and disproportionate. It was my last visit to Madras."

We ordered mango shakes and the straw that came along with mine was bare whereas  my friends had a plastic covering, it's okay whatever about that. Then there were fruit flies everywhere landing on the food and overall being a huge nuisance. Not only this, here was a hair in my cousins masala dosa which they kindly took back and made a new one, however still charged us full price. Another annoying thing was that we had no napkins so we wanted to ask the lady for some, however she was too busy talking on the phone even though she saw us requesting for help, she ignored us. Overall terrible experience which sucks because I had such high hopes."

I went around 12pm to pick up the order to only find out they did not receive the order. I asked how is that possible when I got an email confirmation and I was told that the manager gets the e-mail and is suppose to let them know but they were not told anything. When I was telling them my order I was told that it will take 30min which means an hour. I have ordered from this place a few times via phone and have been told my order will be ready in 20min  and it never is. I have to wait their for another 20 min. I placed the order according to our lunch break. Clearly this online ordering is not working so it needs be removed from your website or changes need to be made or the manager needs to do their job properly.

Restaraunt has zero ambiance . Service is bad, sambhar tastes very diluted, coconut chutney was very watery (it was like 30% coconut and 70% water), idlies tasted like frozen ones u buy from grocery store. Mango shake tastes like it was made with some sort of powdery mix, very artificial taste. Dosas were only good thing and yet they were not anything all that great.  Overall service is garbage too, nobody was standing at cash when he had to pay for the food, we had to wait 10 min for somebody to come. If you want good dosa, I recommend taking a trip to Udupi Madras cafe in missisauga, service and all the food there is amazing, much much better than this impostor of a south indian restaurant."

Fine. I will compare them to what they used to be.A week ago, my family and I decided to go to a south Indian restaurant we used to love. The music used to be great, and the staff was polite, and the food used to be mouthwatering. This time, however, there seems a change in management. Now, you have to pay for the service before even receiving any. The staff are unsmiling, and the food is subpar, and the music blaring in your ears while you try to eat and have a conversation with your family. It was also very disappointing to see non-vegetarian options including a bizarre combination of dosa and butter chicken. The barely-there masala in my masala dosa was ultra bland, and their sambar came in the smallest bowl ever (most probably taken form a child's play set)."

Had visited this place many times before and had found it pretty decent, but today's experience completely changed my view.We order a plate of idly. The chutney was stale and  smelled bad. I told the lady about it and she refused to accept it. Even after I made her smell, she gave an excuse that sometimes the tomatoes are not fresh and what not.Ordered 4 dosas. Dosas had the same batter.  There was too much salt in it. So with that said all the dosas had too much salt. Called the lady and expressed the concern. Being consistent she refused to accept it. She even went on to say that they didn't add any salt to it. But as a goodwill gesture and good hospitality she offers me 1 free dosa. I didn't get what she wanted us to do. 4 ppl sharing one dosa and pay for 4, that we didnt even eat much? Said no to it, paid the bill in full and left. Thy lady didn't show up till we were out. Couldn't have had any worst food experience and customer service.Will never recommend this place.My Response to your response from Nov 26th:Just because none of the customers reported, that does not mean, i being a customer has to be wrong.Staff didn't offer to replace the meal. they offered me one dosa in replacement for 4. (get your facts right)I still didn't get what inappropriate behavior and gestures i made? even after not liking the food and leaving it on the plates as is, i had the courtesy to pay the bill in full. also, i was with my parents and daughter. i cant be behaving inappropriately in front of them, that too with a lady who is elder to me. i did get annoyed and so was your waitress, coz she could not take the negative review and got offended badly.I did not threaten to write the review. i said it to her and wrote it. this is not threatening, this is called sticking to word.Using this platform, for what? this is called right to speak. i gave you my money, my time. It was my parents marriage anniversary yesterday. my dad was specially dressed to have a good evening. Not only did our  evening got spoilt, we left your place hungry. you are still in a win win situation. but who gave you the right to spoil our precious moments?But irony is, you still rate your customers last. there is no sense of apology or even an attempt to see, if there could have been something wrong from your side. you preferred to believe your chef and waitress before even knowing or listening my side of story."

When we entered there were 3 occupied tables and all rest were dirty with flood plates left unattended, we had to wait for someones to clean the table before we can sit and they just cleaned one table rest were left as it is while lady was standing free on counter, another thing, you need to order at counter and pay in advance like fast-food places so just in case if you decided to order something later, you need to go to washroom, clean hands, go back to counter order and pay(btw faucet handle was broken so no water in tap and no paper towels). Which is turn off for many people.  When my order arrived they gave me plastic spoon and no other cutlery.. sambhar was just lukewarm, normally for extra sambhar you need to pay 2$ more @ counter ofcourse and 1$ for chutneys  but lady gave it to me for free but instead of 2 she just gave me just 1 bowl. There was no water at table. Dosa was so soggy it felt like they microwaved previously made dosa. Utappam was just tasteless.

My family and I used to go to this restaurant often but then we moved away so we come once in a few months. In past visits, even at 9pm at least 3-4 of the tables used to be full but this time, there was no customer.  The girl at the counter wanted us to order immediately since they were closing in half an hour. I don't understand closing at 9:30 to begin with. I know we're not the only ones who eat dinner past 9.So because there was half an hour to closing and cooking the chicken items would take about 15 minutes, she refused to take any non- vegetarian orders.  The only reason we went there was to try the non vegetarian menu. We at least received our food promptly. The idli was ok but the vada and dosas tasted of oil and had no salt. She wanted to serve us our coffees with our food, I'm guessing you get us out of their quickly. At one point the waitress actually asked us to finish quickly because they had to shut down!

I was served a wrong dosa, after complaining i got served very unreasonably with subsitute.I gave written complaint to owner and even followed back with staff to see what they have done with my issue. Never heqrd a single word back from owner or management.I think either management don't bother about any complaint or customer service or loosing few customer doesn't make any difference to them.Any restaurant I go, the first thing which appeals me is the way food is served, even if food is not so good I still rate that restaurant higher then I would like. But this place has horrific service, forget about the taste.Don't waste your money here."

Anyways, I highly recommend the south indians living in Brampton, to try this place and eat the Madras special dosa. It might even make you feel that you are living in south india like hyderabad."

Since they make you pay in advance so you can't do anything about it as I could see in their behaviour as if they r not responsible for food quality3. Customer service people had no say as they said they can't do anything . When asked for owner they said he is not here .All this could be one time experience but worst part was that even dosa was just ok . I think the owner has changed from last time I visited . My last time visit here .avoid as there are much better alternatives available

Well, it wasn't just that the entire thali was served cold and tasted absolutely garbage. Usually we have a habit of never leaving food behind coz we respect it but this time my dad couldn't take it any further.
