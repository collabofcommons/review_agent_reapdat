0,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Arpit Singla,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Absolutely enjoyed my lunch at Madras Restaurant recently. The ghee masala dosa was fantastic and tasty. What makes south india food more flavourful is the chutneys and i loved the red and coconut chutney here. The vadas were fresh and crunchy and for the first time in Canada i enjoyed having dahi vada at a south indian restaurant. The taste was just like back home in India. The service was quick, restaurant was clean and had a great vibe. Overall me and my family had a memorable experience and we will definitely be coming again. Do try their lassi also. It‚Äôs refreshing."
1,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Jay Goswami,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",11 months ago,"To start with service, we received food quickly. However food quality is not that great. All chatnies and sambhar were watery and sour in taste. Dosas were way too average. Medu vadas were fried twice and soaked in oil. Idlies were big in size and cooked unevenly. One side was very hard and one side was uncooked. Overall not happy with the quality of food.Owner has responded to my review. So I will have to edit my review. I did not order extra sambhar. I actually order extra white coconut chutney. Reason being sambhar was not good. Eating food to the last bite is my own concern as we are paying for food and we don‚Äôt like to waste food as many people stay hungry. Writing review or giving feedback at restaurant itself is my personal choice and you should not have a say on it. I value my time and Don need any lecture on it. As far as review system you also have right to respond. Good luck and hopefully you guys will expand more."

The sambhar and chutney was amazing tasted just like home! We also tried biryani which was a slight let down as there was less salt, but we ended the night with the filter coffee. And I would say that was the best one I have had since I've been in Brampton!  Definitely coming back to try more dosas!Thank you for your service!"
3,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Nameeta Kashyap,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",a year ago,This I would specially like to mention the service is very good. I liked my ghee Masada dosa very nicely done but I think sambar lacked the punch and the idli was not softVada was hot and piping which was really nice. I like the coconut and red chutney but green one was too salty.

5,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Sudharshan Nandakumar,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"My friend took me to this restaurant and I glad that he did. We ordered Chicken Curry combo thali and Madras Coffee. The Chicken was prepared in same way we prepare at home with coconut and fresh roasted and ground species. The curry was little spicy but I did not mind as I like spicy food which gives heat and makes me sweat.I just have one suggestion related to this dish. The volume of Curry should be reduced, because I did not get to eat rice with other curries.I will return again and refer more of friends to go here.Thank you to chef who prepared the food."
6,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Rahul Awasthi,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Even though I do not belong to South India I was craving for some hot, fresh south indian food because of the pandemic lockdown. Because I had been to Madras restaurant before I came back here to try some of the new dishes. üòã We tried the Hakka Chilli garlic Idli along with vada/dosa regulars. Hakka idli wasn't super awesome but definitely worth trying once for a different taste. I am just happy that dining has resumed and looking forward to eating out more often now. You should also try their mango lassi if you are into that.Images"
7,Google,MADRAS RESTAURANT- True Taste of South India,Deepanshu Kainthola,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,I wish this place was closer to my home so I could visit more often. I have tried many South Indian restaurants in and around Toronto but this yummy experience was by far the best.I had a butter masala dosa and the taste definitely reminded me of food in India.It seems the chefs knows what they are making and for whom.A must visit if you are looking to try a new south indian place. You will keep coming back for sure.

I must say this place has some authentic flavours of India, both North + South Indian food. The staff followed all safety measures and served hot and yummy properly packed meals. Do give it a try if you are looking for some famous Indian delicacies to make your day a special one, I am sure you won't regret it!"
